# Tomateiro
This paper presents an approach focused on improving the quality of the tomato crops. Thus, to achieve such goal, we designed and implemented a computational environment to support decision-making related to the tomato production. Our focus is to automate the detection of tomatoes late blight, with the aid of pre-processing images.
